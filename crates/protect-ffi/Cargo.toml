# cipherstash-client specifies winnow 0.6.20 in its deps, but uses exports from `winnow::prelude`
# that aren't available until later versions. 0.6.26 is what cipherstash-client uses in its lockfile
# at the time of this change. Using 0.6.26 prevents compiler errors due to missing exports in 0.6.20.
