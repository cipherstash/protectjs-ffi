# jseql-ffi

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are looking to implement this package into your application please use the official [jseql package](https://github.com/cipherstash/jseql).

This project provides the JS bindings for the CipherStash Client Rust SDK and is bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Building

Building requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

To run the build, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command uses the [@neon-rs/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neon-rs/cli) utility to assemble the binary Node addon from the output of `cargo`.

## Exploring

After building `jseql-ffi`, you can explore its exports at the Node console.
`CS_CLIENT_ID` and `CS_CLIENT_KEY` must be set in your environment for the call to `newClient()` to succeed.

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run build
$ node
> const addon = require(".");
> const client = await addon.newClient();
> const ciphertext = await addon.encrypt(client, "plaintext", "column_name");
> const plaintext = await addon.decrypt(client, ciphertext);
> console.log({ciphertext, plaintext});
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source, generating a release build with `cargo --release`.

Additional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm run build` and similar commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):

```
npm run build -- --feature=beetle
```

#### `npm run debug`

Similar to `npm run build` but generates a debug build with `cargo`.

#### `npm run cross`

Similar to `npm run build` but uses [cross-rs](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to cross-compile for another platform. Use the [`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildtarget) environment variable to select the build target.

#### `npm run release`

Initiate a full build and publication of a new patch release of this library via GitHub Actions.

#### `npm run dryrun`

Initiate a dry run of a patch release of this library via GitHub Actions. This performs a full build but does not publish the final result.

#### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Releasing

Releases are handled by GitHub Actions using a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger.
The [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) was generated by [Neon](https://neon-rs.dev/).

The release workflow is responsible for:
- Building and publishing the main `@cipherstash/jseql-ffi` package as well as the native packages for each platform (e.g. `@cipherstash/jseql-ffi-darwin-arm64`).
- Creating the GitHub release.
- Creating a Git tag for the version.

To perform a release:
1. Navigate to the ["Release" workflow page](https://github.com/cipherstash/jseql-ffi/actions/workflows/release.yml) in GitHub.
1. Click on "Run workflow".
1. Select the branch to release from.
Use the default of "main" unless you want to do a pre-release version or dry run from a branch.
1. Select whether or not to do a dry run.
Dry runs are useful for verifying that the build will succeed for all platforms before doing a full run with a publish.
1. Choose a version to publish.
The options are similar to [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-version).
Select "custom" in the dropdown and fill in the "Custom version" text box if you want to use a semver string instead of the shorthand (patch, minor, major, etc.).
1. Click "Run workflow".

Note that we currently don't have any automation around release notes or a changelog.
However, you can add release notes after running the workflow by editing the release on GitHub.
